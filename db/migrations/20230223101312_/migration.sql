  Warnings:

  - The `status` column on the `Item` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - Changed the type of `status` on the `FileIntegration` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Changed the type of `status` on the `ItemIntegration` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Changed the type of `status` on the `UrlIntegration` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
